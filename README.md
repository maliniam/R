**Examining Equity Across SDG 6.2.1a Progress in Thailand Using R and Tableau**

*Abstract*

Following the conclusion of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), the UN set forth the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in 2015 to be adopted by all UN member countries, including Thailand (IMF, 2023). An environmental concern that Thailand has struggled with since the implementation of the UN’s MDGs and SDGs is access to sustainably managed water and water sanitation services (UN, n.d.; World, n.d.). The goal of this analysis was to examine Thailand’s reported progress on SDG 6.2.1a, the "proportion of population using safely managed sanitation services (UN, n.d.-a)", to determine whether progress on the goal is equal across the country’s rural and urban regions. The results of this analysis revealed that SDG 6.2.1a attainment has been unequally observed between rural and urban regions, suggesting a potential disparity in access in sanitation services. Moreover, further examination of this relationship revealed the disparity between regions may be growing over time.  For this reason, it is recommended that equitable access remains a key consideration for Thailand as the country continues to make progress on improving its water sources, availability, and sanitation services.
